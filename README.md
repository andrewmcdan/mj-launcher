# MJ Launcher
This is a fairly simple Node.js application that launches Chromium in kiosk mode, points it to my instance of [MJ Images Favorites Downloader](https://github.com/andrewmcdan/MJ-image-favorites-downloader), and monitors it to ensure that the slideshow stays running. It is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi 3/4/5, but surely it can run anything that can run Node.js.
